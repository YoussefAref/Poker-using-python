# Poker-using-python
This is yet another project where the famous real life game of poker was compiled on python in a way that the code will compare two different hands using the fucntion comapre_hands( by hands it means set of 5 cards).
After comparing both hands depending on the rules of the real life game if the first hand wins, it would return 1 and if the other hand wins it will return -1, or 0 if the same hands are played.
